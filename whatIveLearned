1) This:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572897/how-does-javascript-prototype-work

has a good explanation of prototype, etc and why it's confusing to people.

2) If you create an object from a constructor like this:
myInstance = new MyClass
and then JSON.stringify(myInstance) and send the JSONified
myInstance to localStorage then later retrieve it (after
JSON.parse()) 
The prototype chain of myInstance gets lost (as you might expect
because JSON.stringify() simply converts stuff to JSON format).
So you have to reconnect myInstance to MyClass to 
reconnect the prototype chain.
The only way I could work out how to do this was: 
newInstance = new MyClass
newInstance.title  = myInstance.title 
newInstance.author = myInstance.author
etc
This is clunky!
